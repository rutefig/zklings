## Finite Fields

**Finite fields** are a core element of cryptography and crucial when working with zero knowledge proofs. The goal within this chapter is to develop an intuition of the properties of a finite fiels and why they are important.

We will start by looking at groups, which are the building blocks of finite fields.
